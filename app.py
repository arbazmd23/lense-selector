- Current Stage: {stage}

STAGE CONTEXT: {stage_context}

RESEARCH LENSES TO ANALYZE:

SME (Subject Matter Expert Research):
- What: Direct interviews with domain experts, industry veterans, technical specialists, regulatory experts
- Provides: Deep technical validation, industry standards, regulatory requirements, feasibility assessment
- Best when: Complex technical challenges, regulated industries, specialized knowledge gaps, feasibility questions

Peer (Peer-to-Peer Research):
- What: Conversations with fellow entrepreneurs, startup founders, business leaders who've faced similar challenges
- Provides: Business model validation, go-to-market strategies, operational insights, scaling experiences
- Best when: Business strategy questions, operational challenges, fundraising, scaling decisions

Survey (Quantitative Research):
- What: Structured questionnaires to collect statistical data from target users/customers
- Provides: Market size validation, feature prioritization, pricing insights, user preference quantification

RANKING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Assign ranks 1-4 where 1 = most valuable, 4 = least valuable
2. Each lens must have a UNIQUE rank (no ties)
3. Rank based on which method provides the MOST ACTIONABLE insights for this specific startup at this stage
4. Consider: stage needs + domain complexity + target market + business model + title specifics + description details + tag implications
5. Rankings must vary significantly across different contexts - avoid defaulting to same patterns
6. CRITICAL: Analyze the COMPLETE startup context (title + description + tags + stage) to determine rankings

CONTEXT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Analyze the startup TITLE for business model clues
- Analyze the DESCRIPTION for technical complexity, target market, and value proposition
- Analyze the TAGS for domain, technology stack, and market type
- Analyze the STAGE for specific research needs at this phase
- Combine ALL these factors to determine optimal research lens ranking
